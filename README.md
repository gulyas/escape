ESCAPE
======

ESCAPE: Extensible Service ChAin Prototyping Environment using Mininet, Click, NETCONF and POX.

Usage instructions are over [here](http://sb.tmit.bme.hu/mediawiki/index.php/ESCAPE).

This project is obsoleted by
[ESCAPEv2](https://github.com/hsnlab/escape), which has slightly
different goals and is an almost complete rewrite of ESCAPE.
